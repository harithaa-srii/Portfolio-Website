      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-justify">
        I’m <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">Harithaa Srii</span>, a passionate Frontend Developer with{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">11 months of professional experience</span> in the IT industry. I specialize in
        building responsive, user-friendly web interfaces using technologies like{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Angular, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</span>, and I also have beginner-level knowledge in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">React and Figma</span>.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
        I graduated with a <span className="font-medium">Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology</span> in 2024, and
        worked as an <span className="font-medium">Associate Software Engineer at Maplelabs (a unit of Xoriant Corporation)</span>.
        During my tenure, I contributed to the development of multiple frontend components using Angular, performed internal
        library integrations, and implemented API integrations for various Sizer applications.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
        My interest in frontend extended beyond Angular as I started exploring <span className="font-medium">React</span> and
        gradually developed a strong inclination toward <span className="font-medium">UI/UX Design</span>. I'm currently upskilling
        in both areas while building personal projects and my portfolio.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
        Beyond development, I’ve worked as a <span className="font-medium">freelance content writer</span> during my college days,
        creating SEO-friendly website content for businesses. My strong documentation skills were also evident in the detailed
        handover documents I prepared during my corporate experience.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4 text-justify">
        I’m actively seeking roles that focus on <span className="font-semibold">Frontend Development</span> or hybrid roles that
        blend both <span className="font-semibold">Frontend and UI/UX Design</span>. I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced
        environments where I can contribute to intuitive, meaningful digital experiences.
